# Story authoring experiments

[Issue #82](https://github.com/Caldwell-41/Renpy-editor/issues/82) compares three
unapproved Story workspaces. Kris asked for a large WYSIWYG game window with room
for future character dragging, alongside low-friction writing and beat creation.
The current set refines Cue sheet and Shot reel and replaces the rejected third
layout with Stage tracks. Production Story is unchanged.

Kris has since approved independent refinement of all three, with one Opus 5.5 lead
at high per mock and each lead's own Opus/Sol council at xhigh. The current target
is 9.5/10 from both reviewers for each implemented mock. Main, Writing focus,
properties, dialogs and secondary states all count. All Round 2 councils finished;
their remaining fixes are implemented and verified. Kris requested screenshots and
a pause here before the final council. These fixes have no new council scores.

## Current comparison

Claude Opus 5.5 at high reasoning designed this revision after inspecting the
existing mocks, Story and 3C/3D requirements, and seven selected reference images.
Nongine's script beside a game window and Visual Novel Maker's stage/script
relationship informed the layouts. The parent implemented the designs in the lab.

- **Cue sheet** puts a large stage on the left and a complete editable script on
  the right. Speakers align with their lines. Choices, conditions, state and flow
  edit directly in their script rows. Media fields open below the stage; compact
  windows and Writing focus put those fields inline. This favors reading and
  revising surrounding lines.
- **Shot reel** uses the largest stage, a slim property dock and a short ordered
  beat reel. On desktop, dialogue is edited in the game's proportioned say box.
  Hide text box clears the composition and moves writing to the dock. Compact
  windows use the dock below the stage. This favors composition and direct editing.
- **Stage tracks** puts the stage and an editor above statement columns for
  background, character, words, sound and flow. Selecting a column moves the
  playhead. A manual branch band changes the visible source body. Writing focus
  presents beats as rows. This favors seeing which beat changes a scene's contents.
  Columns have no elapsed time, playback or keyframes.

All three keep the scene chooser closed by default. It opens as an overlay without
shrinking the stage. Navigation starts collapsed, comparison controls stay in the
footer, and Enlarge stage preserves the current beat. The stage keeps the game's
16:9 aspect ratio. Authoring forms remain outside it; only the game dialogue box
and game choice menu overlay characters.

## Open the mocks

Run `npm run design:dev` from `app/` with the pinned Node tools. The screen is
`story-revamp`; its variants are `cue-sheet`, `shot-reel` and `stage-tracks`.
For example:

`http://127.0.0.1:5174/preview.html?screen=story-revamp&variant=cue-sheet&state=populated&theme=dark&viewport=wide`

The footer changes layouts. The lab also offers empty, nested-branch and protected
source samples. Changing layout or sample resets fictional content after guarding
edits. Writing focus preserves the selected beat, branch and edited content.

For standalone review files, run
`node design-lab/screens/story-revamp/export.mjs` from `app/`. It writes HTML files
under ignored `.toolchains/story-revamp/`. The hosted lab uses the full browser
window; standalone exports include an additional sample selector.

## Interactions and limits

Create or rename a scene, write dialogue/narration, search for and insert beats,
edit media and screen statements, create guarded choices and destination scenes,
write in nested bodies, move or delete eligible beats, and undo/redo. Every insert
names its source body and position. Choice/Jump/Return replace that body's ending.
Shift+Cmd/Ctrl+Enter adds dialogue with the last dialogue speaker on the selected
source path. Cmd/Ctrl+Enter closes
the typing burst. Slash in an empty line replaces that line through the picker.

Selecting a visible character or the background identifies its contributing beat.
Edit that beat or explicitly add a change before the current beat in the same body.
An "In effect" list links media to the beats that set it. Actor and appearance
changes use distinct fictional vector samples. A new Background clears characters.
A gesture does not silently rewrite an earlier beat. Free dragging and resizing
are not implemented. Protected source stays read-only. The sample Assist flow
prepares, reviews and accepts a fictional proposal and sends no model request.

All changes stay in browser memory. The scene uses original vector sample art,
not Ren'Py rendering. The selected source path supplies illustrative cues; no
conditions or variables are evaluated, Calls are not followed, and unresolved
branches/custom source/Calls remain partial or unknown. Manual preview choice is
separate from the editing target. Audio is not played.

These mocks do not prove source transactions, native behavior, durable saves,
external edits or recovery. Chapter lifecycle, branch unwrapping, the full Assist
catalogue and call-stack navigation remain production requirements. No project,
provider, SDK or native game operation is performed.

Future drag/resize belongs on the large stage. Appearance, idle and animation fields
fit in the selected-object dock. Timeline can open for the selected beat; ordered
tracks do not substitute for its interaction boundaries or source contract. State
provenance and supported Run From Here need deliberate inspection and launch flows.
These connections are notes, not working-looking future controls.

## Evidence and selection

Current refinement evidence lives under ignored
`.toolchains/story-revamp/council-v3/`. Each variant has an initial council report.
`revised/MANIFEST.md` records 92 browser screenshots and the original failures.
`candidate/` passes the 72-render matrix and full tracked interaction journey.
Its measured stages meet all three size requirements, with Stage tracks measuring
622 × 350 on laptop after expanding its dock to keep every track row visible.
`closure/` fixes remaining text-field clipping and keyboard new-line focus. Its
tracked journey and active-writing checks pass for all variants at wide and compact
sizes. Fresh main/focus screenshots accompany both passes.
The later `round-2-fixes/` evidence qualifies the current revision: 72 renders, the
full tracked journey and 21 focused checks pass. It contains visual/focused captures
at desktop, laptop and compact sizes, plus changed branch, picker and keyboard
flows. The first focused attempt used an invalid laptop URL and checked scheduled
focus before its animation frame; those failures are retained separately. All
three Round 2 reports remain beside the evidence. No final council ran after these
fixes. Do not treat diagnostic copies with altered assertions as passing an
original check. Kris has paused the work for screenshot review.

### Historical baseline

The original set at local commit `1c6ed025` received two council review rounds.
Those scores and checks apply to that original set. Its review files and captures
are retained under ignored `.toolchains/story-revamp/revision-1/`, alongside the
Git history. No design was approved. This revision follows Kris's subsequent
feedback and Opus's high-reasoning design pass, rather than claiming the earlier
scores for changed layouts.

The browser matrix passes 72 renders across three variants, four samples, two themes
and three window sizes, plus the create/write/insert/focus/history journey. Terra
inspected all nine dark visual captures and the focused views. Stage dimensions
measured in CSS pixels are:

| Variant | 1600 × 1000 window | 1100 × 720 window | 560 × 640 window |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cue sheet | 988 × 556 | 654 × 368 | 486 × 273 |
| Shot reel | 1216 × 684 | 718 × 404 | 486 × 273 |
| Stage tracks | 1024 × 576 | 633 × 356 | 486 × 273 |

Every stage preserves 16:9, fills the compact content width, and meets the intended
minimums of 960 × 540 on desktop and 620 × 349 on laptop. Editor/chrome hit tests
found no obstruction in the normal view. Dialogue, character ownership, manual
branches, focus/enlargement, scene-drawer behavior and resize/caret retention pass.
No continuously running animations or page exceptions were observed. A missing lab
favicon produced one console 404; this does not affect the Story mocks.

The first run caught compact Next dialogue clipping. The next pass caught duplicate
Cue sheet empty actions and compact start actions below the visible editor. Those
were fixed. After two Terra attempts, the parent closed the bounded empty-state and
standalone-footer findings with 15 focused cases and inspected their corrected
captures. Original failed checks remain in the ignored reports and delegate results;
a keyboard assertion whose inspection moved focus has its separate passing follow-up.

Typechecking, approval validation, repository validation and production-build
exclusion pass. Browser launches ran outside the macOS sandbox with scoped
permission, using check-owned browsers. The hosted Design Lab remains available.
Reports, screenshots and a review bundle are under `.toolchains/story-revamp/`.
All approval pointers remain null. Kris will choose the next iteration; no
production promotion or future engine implementation is selected.
